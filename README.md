# butterflyNet
Predicting butterfly host status of plants based on mass spec chemistry data using neural networks with Keras

* `H1ForNeural.csv` contains host status and mass spec chemistry data for plant samples.
* `neural_net_functions.py` contains code to fit neural network and get out-of-sample predictions using leave-one-out CV
* `run_experiment.py` contains code to fit neural networks with different numbers and sizes of hidden layers.
* `neural_net_predictions.csv` and `loo_auc.csv` contain out-of-sample prediction and AUC values, respectively, generated by `run_experiment.py`
